## Goals
 In this tutorial, the goal was to build and boot a custom Linux kernel for ARM using kw (kworkflow). With kw, it became much easier to access my virtual machine, mainly because I didn't have to worry 
about my IP anymore. The problem I was having before kw (with my IP changing in the middle of the tutorial) did not happen anymore.

## Problems and Difficulties
 In this tutorial, one of the notable problems I had was understanding how to compile the code using my PC architecture (AMD64/x86_64), but creating files for my virtual machine architecture (ARM64). 
I learned that this process is called **cross-compiling**. To make it work, I had to install a specific compiler (`gcc-aarch64-linux`) capable of generating ARM binaries from my AMD64 machine.
 Another thing was, since my virtual machine image was too basic, I had to install other tools to continue with the tutorial. 

Some other small problems I had were:
- Multiple changes to activate.sh
- Needing to install tools to be able to proceed with the tutorial (e.g., rsync)
